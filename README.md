# CEN4930C_Project_CAW
The project is called "Car Accidents during Specifc Weather Conditions" and, as the title says,
we will research if climate has an effect on the number car accidents that occur daily in the state of Florida.
For this final project, weather data will be collected from an API called OpenWeatherMap which provides information 
like weather condition (sunny, cloudy, rainy...) and temperature for specific regions depending of the longitude/latitude coordinates. 
In this case, there only 7 locations in Florida from where data will be gathered:
Tallahassee, Jacksonville, Gainesville, Orlando, Tampa, Fort Myers, and Miami
These locations cover the main part of the state and, in this way, it will provide more accurate information for the whole state in general.
Asides from the API, another tool that will be used is the Florida Highway Patrol's Live Traffic Crash and Road Condition Report page to
determine the amount of car accidents in these regions (link will be in the assets folder of this repository).
